# Postmortem #001: Performance Degradation on Page Load

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Resolved

## Summary

After implementing scenario planner conflict detection and capacity tracking features, the application experienced severe performance degradation on initial page load, taking several seconds to display content. Users reported "no TASKS loaded" messages appearing until page refresh.

## Impact

- **Users Affected**: All users of the scenario planner
- **Duration**: From feature deployment until fix
- **Symptoms**:
  - Page load time increased from <1s to 3-5 seconds
  - "No TASKS loaded" message appearing on initial render
  - UI appearing frozen during load

## Root Cause

Multiple React `useMemo` hooks were missing:
1. **Early return guards**: Computations ran on empty arrays during initial render
2. **Missing dependency**: `excludedEpicSet` used in `scenarioAssigneeConflicts` but not in dependency array, causing incorrect memoization

### Affected Computations

12 expensive `useMemo` hooks were running unnecessary operations:

```javascript
// BEFORE: No guard
const scenarioAssigneeConflicts = React.useMemo(() => {
    const conflicts = new Set();
    scenarioTimelineIssues.forEach(issue => { /* expensive work */ });
    return { conflicts, conflictDetails };
}, [scenarioTimelineIssues]); // Missing excludedEpicSet dependency!
```

**Problem**:
- `forEach` runs even when `scenarioTimelineIssues` is empty or undefined
- Missing `excludedEpicSet` in dependency array caused stale data and extra re-renders
- 12 such computations cascading = significant CPU time wasted

## Timeline

- **T+0**: Feature deployed with conflict detection
- **T+1**: User reports: "takes too much time to show the page"
- **T+5**: Investigation begins
- **T+10**: Root cause identified
- **T+15**: Fix implemented and deployed

## Resolution

### Fix #1: Add Early Returns

Added guards to all 12 affected `useMemo` hooks:

```javascript
// AFTER: With guard
const scenarioAssigneeConflicts = React.useMemo(() => {
    // Early return if no data to avoid unnecessary computation
    if (!scenarioTimelineIssues || scenarioTimelineIssues.length === 0) {
        return { conflicts: new Set(), conflictDetails: new Map() };
    }
    const conflicts = new Set();
    scenarioTimelineIssues.forEach(issue => { /* expensive work */ });
    return { conflicts, conflictDetails };
}, [scenarioTimelineIssues, excludedEpicSet]); // Fixed dependency array
```

### Fix #2: Correct Dependency Arrays

Added missing `excludedEpicSet` to `scenarioAssigneeConflicts` dependency array.

### Affected Hooks

1. `scenarioSearchMatchSet`
2. `scenarioExcludedIssueKeys`
3. `scenarioIssueByKey`
4. `scenarioBaseEnd`
5. `scenarioFocusIssueKeys`
6. `scenarioAssigneeConflicts` (also missing dependency)
7. `scenarioLaneInfo`
8. `scenarioIssuesByLane`
9. `scenarioHasAssignees`
10. `scenarioUnschedulable`
11. `scenarioLaneStacking`

## Verification

After fix:
- ✅ Page load time: <1 second
- ✅ No "TASKS loaded" blocking message
- ✅ Immediate UI responsiveness
- ✅ Correct memoization behavior

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Issue was quickly identified through systematic analysis
- Fix was straightforward once root cause was found
- All similar issues were fixed proactively

### What Could Be Improved
- **Pre-deployment testing**: Should have tested with empty data states
- **Performance monitoring**: Add performance marks to detect regressions
- **Dependency validation**: Need lint rules to catch missing dependencies
- **Code review**: Guard clauses should be standard practice for `useMemo` with iterations

## Action Items

- [x] Add early return guards to all expensive `useMemo` hooks
- [x] Fix missing dependencies in memoization arrays
- [ ] Add ESLint rule: `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` enforcement
- [ ] Add performance tests for page load with empty data
- [ ] Document best practices for `useMemo` in contributing guide
- [ ] Consider performance budget metrics in CI
