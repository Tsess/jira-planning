# Monday TODO

- Planning table visual improvement for totals, tech, and product sections.
- Sprint planning results panel: write specs and requirements.
- Use local test data for tests:
  - `tech.test.local.json`
  - `product.test.local.json`
- Add alert panel for stories missing story points (0) and pin those epics/stories to the top.
- Visualize and fetch dependencies between tasks; decide if a new panel is needed.
