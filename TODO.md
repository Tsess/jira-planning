# Monday TODO

- ✅ Groups selector: ability to create groups of teams to better alignment if the scope is wide.
- Create a configuration of the env in the UI
- Scenario planner follow-ups (optional): scenario comparison/export.
- Scenario planner: add a small legend for blocked/excluded/quarter markers.
- Config: decide on frontend bundling path
  - Full rewrite to vanilla JS (no React, no Babel, no CDN).
  - Keep React but bundle locally (no internet access, no source-map warning).

Whistles
